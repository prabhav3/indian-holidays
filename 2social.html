        <h2>Social</h2>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Diwali: Diwali is the festival of lights that celebrates light over dark. People light firecrackers and they believe this guides the goddess Lakshmi. Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Holi: The myth Hiranyakashipu focuses on a demon king. The demon king whose name is the namesake of this myth tries to kill his own for worshipping Vishnu (a god). He makes his wife Holika try to kill his son by leading him into a fire, but she ends up burning and Vishnu kills the demon. Another myth that people believe led to Holi was the story of Krishna and Radha. In the story, the god Krishna falls in love with the milkmaid Radha. He is jealous that Radha looks so beautiful and fair while his skin is dark blue. He sets up a way for him to look better by throwing colored water which inspired today’s holiday Holi.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Clothing: During festivals like Holi and Diwali, people wear tons of cool clothing. A very popular style of embroidering on Indian clothes is geometrical patterns engraved in silk. They put this on button-down shirts and saris.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Sankranti: Another holiday is Makar Sankranti. On this holiday, people mark Uttarayan which marks the northward movement of the sun. This holiday is based mostly on superstition. Sankranti, the namesake of the holiday is believed to be a divinity who executed the evil named Sankarasur. The day after Sankranti is called Kinkrant which is the day when Devi killed the Kinkarasur.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Ugadi: The holiday Ugadi is Indian New Year. The Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana celebrate the holiday. This is also the day that Marathi and Konkani Indians celebrate Gudi Padwa.                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Food: At Indian festivals, people eat vegetarian food. This is because most gods are vegetarian. People eat pulihora, which translates to tiger rice, probably due to its color.  They also eat other common delicacies such as olige, mango pickle, and ugadi pacchadi on Ugadi (It’s not very good, however).
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Republic Day: On Republic Day, people hold a parade in the capital city New Dehli. It includes cultural, historical, and military displays. Smaller parades and celebrations also happen all around India.
