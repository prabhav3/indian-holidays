        <h2>Economic</h2>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Clothing: On most Indian holidays, people buy new clothing. Clothes consist of embroidered button-down shirts and dresses called saris. Street vendors usually sell most amount of clothes during this time. From my experience, jewelry stores are usually packed.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Sankranti: During Makar Sankranti, people mark the harvest season. This is when most people decide to begin the harvest and they do so because of the superstition of the northward movement of the sun.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Diwali: On Diwali, people buy diyas (lamps) and firecrackers to celebrate. Diyas are believed to guide the goddess of wealth into homes and bring wealth to those she visits.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Dassehra: On Dasserha, people buy and construct a massive statue of the demon Ravana. On the holiday, they light up the statue and it burns to the ground, showing how they have won over the demon. 
                This statue alone costs Rs 13 lakhs or around 1.4 million dollars. Of course, Indiaâ€™s money has a buying power of three times that of a U.S. dollar.
                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Ramadan: Even though Ramadan is a religious holiday, it makes a big economic impact. Food bills increase by almost double during Ramadan, and it is believed that Ramadan is the reason for 15% of food expenditure annually.
                Egypt once ate 9 million dried fruits which accounted for 35% of annual trade in Ramadan.
                Restaurants get business booms during Ramadan because 46% of people like to eat out for Iftar, the after-dusk meal. 26% ordered delivery for Iftar, and 78% planned to eat at a cafe for Iftar.
                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Eid-al-Fitr: During Eid-al-Fitr markets that have clothing receive bumper sales. Commercial banks witness a heavy rush for transactions as a huge number of people withdraw money. Banks end up borrowing from the call money market and borrowing collectively 1,000 crores taka.
                Surely reduced working hours and fasting would reduce productivity, right? Work-from-home jobs have introduced flexible working hours and ways for people to be productive during Ramadan. Working from home allows you to spend less time getting to and from work and simply lets you be productive.
                </li>
