Diwali: Although Diwali seems like a great holiday, it does have downsides. It causes pollution due to harmful gases going into the air, making it a cause of global warming. Maybe lay off the fireworks next time.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Burning: Lots of Indian holidays consist of burning things. This is because fire is an extremely important part of our lives. But still, fire isn’t great for the environment as it lets out smoke that pollutes the air, and the stuff they burn such as straw and firecrackers lets out other harmful gases.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Pollution: Festivals don’t just cause by-the-book pollution. Festivals usually have blaring loudspeakers or megaphones, and that causes noise pollution. Noise pollution disrupts breeding cycles and is leading to the extinction of animals sooner than later.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Noise: Citizens in India who celebrate these festivals go well over the noise cap of 55 decibels during the day and 45 decibels at night. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that noise pollution not only affects animals but is a public nuisance as well because high-decibel noises cause hearing issues in children and cause disorders as well.
</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
Water: During some holidays, lots of water pollution occurs. Flowers and parts of clay idols are left in the waters of India after festivals, causing the high levels of mercury and lead in the idols to leech into the water.
Toxins from idols dumped in the water disrupt the marine ecosystem and cause death in the food chain. The water is saturated with toxins and paint, synthetic material, and plastic waste.
                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Dry Waste: There has been a yearly increase in RSPM in the air due to the bursting of fireworks and firecrackers. RSPM is Respirable Suspended Particulate Material. They are minute particles proven to contribute to illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis.
                During festivals like Diwali, there is tons of dry waste being deposited. Firecrackers take up lots of space and end up being littered all over the place.
                                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Organic Waste: There is a lot of wasted food and items like fruits, camphor, and incense is wasted too. People need to be more mindful of the things they are wasting and polluting the environment with.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                Conclusion: Even though Indian festivals negatively affect the environment, people are moving to get rid of waste. Some idol makers have stopped putting paint with mercury or lead in them, and getting rid of synthetic materials.
